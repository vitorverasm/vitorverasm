## About me

I'm deeply passionate about Mobile Development, Front-end technologies, and UX Design. Crafting intuitive interfaces and solving complex problems are at the heart of what I do. My goal is to be a versatile, T-shaped developer: specializing in mobile and front-end development while having a strong understanding of the entire application lifecycle.

### Front-end Excellence
In the realm of Front-end development, I am dedicated to enhancing usability and user experience. I prioritize accessibility, performance, and stability, while ensuring my code is well-organized, readable, and consistently delivered.

### Back-end & Infrastructure Mastery
On the Back-end and Infrastructure side, my focus is on designing robust service architectures, ensuring seamless communication, and implementing strategies for decoupling, availability, and redundancy. I strive for high performance and scalability in all my projects.

### Technologies & Tools
- React Native/Expo
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- NodeJS (NestJS)
- Golang
- Unit and E2E testing (Jest and Detox)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitrise, and app automation with Fastlane)
